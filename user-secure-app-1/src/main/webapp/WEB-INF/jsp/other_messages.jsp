	<h2>This appendix provides a reference to the elements available
		in the security namespace and information on the underlying beans they
		create (a knowledge of the individual classes and how they work
		together is assumed - you can find more information in the project
		Javadoc and elsewhere in this document). If you haven't used the
		namespace before, please read the introductory chapter on namespace
		configuration, as this is intended as a supplement to the information
		there. Using a good quality XML editor while editing a configuration
		based on the schema is recommended as this will provide contextual
		information on which elements and attributes are available as well as
		comments explaining their purpose. The namespace is written in RELAX
		NG Compact format and later converted into an XSD schema. If you are
		familiar with this format, you may wish to examine the schema file
		directly.</h2>
